# LocalRES-DB
Repository with all the resources related to the [LocalRES](https://www.localres.eu/) project database.

**Disclaimer:**

LocalRES “Empowering local renewable energy communities for the decarbonisation of the energy systems” is an EU-funded project under the Horizon 2020 Programme (Grant Agreement no. 957819) which focuses on the figure of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) as key actors to lead the structural change towards the decarbonisation of the local energy systems. Thus, the project will develop digital tools aiming at boosting the setting up of RECs and foster the engagement of citizens and other local stakeholders to participate actively in the energy transition. In particular, in the scope of the project a Planning Tool will be developed to enable the participation of citizens and local actors in the decision-making processes associated to the planning of a REC. An essential part of the Planning Tool is the LocalRES database, which will have different purposes of relevance for the proper use and integration of the different modules constituting the tool.
